      tools and languages that I have become quite good at.

        I am in the 4rd year of Univerrsity and my favourite projects so far have been the ones that are in python, as that is the language
        I have more experience with.

    - role: Freelance Programmer

        Trying to expand my knowledge on fields like A.I. mainly using python. A few of the libraries that I have used in python are Tkinter(a GUI tool for python) 
        where I made an app with mutliple pages(this was made with me and one more student), Qiskit a quantum programing library that simulates quantum computers, even 
        though i didn't really keep up with this library and lastly the one I have used as of late nltk a library used for NLP(natural language processing).
        
        The GUI app I made with a friend of mine(Θεόφιλος Παπαδόπουλος) is at his [github](https://github.com/gordthrow/multimedia-project). It is a small app made mostly to see how to work
        with the tkinter library of python and other than that and the fact that we messed a bit with settings its really basic.
        
        To get some experience before making this project I made a simple calculator using the tkinter library you can find that one [HERE](https://github.com/alexpoulis/CalculatorProject)
        
        I have also done some web scraping that proved usefull in doing [THIS](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DIcGbVGp03O85vJCC3VStH9rxkHW1P3M) assignment
        we had last year. Other than that on my own I have tried out Unity briefly and I have programmed some simple perceptrons and neural networks in python.
